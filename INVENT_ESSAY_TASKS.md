1. Assess the relevance of each candidate's professional experience to the job description. Examine the nature, context, and domain of their past work rather than simply counting years. Determine how directly the candidate's professional history maps onto the responsibilities and domain of the open role. Candidates whose prior work closely resembles what the job requires should be ranked higher than those with extensive but tangentially related experience.

2. Evaluate how well each candidate's skills align with the specific requirements listed in the job description. Consider both technical competencies such as tools, certifications, and methodologies, as well as interpersonal skills like leadership, collaboration, and communication. Give preference to applications that demonstrate skills through context and narrative rather than those that merely list skills without connecting them to real work.

3. Assess whether each candidate provides evidence of measurable results and tangible accomplishments in their prior roles. Look for quantified achievements, before-and-after descriptions, and concrete examples of value the candidate has driven — such as growing revenue, reducing costs, improving processes, or shipping products. Rank candidates who demonstrate impact through specific outcomes higher than those who only describe responsibilities they held.

4. Evaluate the quality of each application as a piece of writing. Consider the clarity of structure, conciseness, professionalism, grammatical correctness, and overall readability. A well-organized and clearly written application reflects strong communication skills and attention to detail. Applications that are disorganized, error-prone, or excessively verbose should be ranked lower on this dimension regardless of their content.

5. Examine the arc of each candidate's career for evidence of growth and increasing responsibility. Look for patterns of progression from junior to senior roles, broadening scope, and intentional transitions into areas of greater complexity. Consider whether the role being applied for represents a logical next step in the candidate's professional development. Candidates who demonstrate upward momentum and a capacity for learning should be ranked higher.

6. Evaluate whether each application has been tailored specifically to the job in question. Look for explicit references to the company, the role, or the particular challenges mentioned in the job description. Determine whether the candidate has drawn clear connections between their background and what the employer is seeking. Generic applications that could be submitted to any employer without modification should be ranked lower than those that show deliberate effort and genuine interest in the specific opportunity.
